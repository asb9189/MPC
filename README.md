# MPC Simulation Repository

Throughout this repository you will find a README in each directory explaining how to execute each simulation.
Furthermore, you can find more detailed documentation on star_tcp here: https://asb9189.github.io/MPC/

While this documentation was not created for each individual simulation it seemed unnecessary as the simulations are nearly identical
in implementation. The only thing that differs is how the config.ini files are generated (generate.py) and how they are parsed (summation.py).
The in line code comments should help to explain this process and aside from that the server IP and client side IP will change depending on
where this simulation is being executed.
